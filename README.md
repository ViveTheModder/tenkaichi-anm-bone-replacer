# tenkaichi-anm-tail-replacer
A command-line modding tool for the PS2 version of Budokai Tenkaichi 2 or 3 that can **edit ANM files from those games**, by **taking the tail bone contents of ANMs** located in a source folder, and **assigning them** to ANMs located in a destination folder.

For the program to work as intended, the ANM files in both source & destination folders **do not necessarily need to have identical file names**.

However, the **number of ANMs in both folders must be the same**, and to match a source ANM with a destination ANM, the ANMs in both folders must be sorted such that **the intended order of the ANMs is the same**.
A good way of achieving this is to number the ANMs in both folders the same way.

For example: ``SRC01.anm -> DST01.anm``, ``SRC02.anm -> DST02.anm``, and so on...
